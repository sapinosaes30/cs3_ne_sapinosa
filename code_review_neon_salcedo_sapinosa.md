**The problem: Search for a Number in a Sorted List**

**For example: Both algorithms could search:**   
numbers \= \[5, 12, 18, 23, 31, 47, 56, 68, 74, 90\]  
target \= 47

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| def linear\_search(numbers, target):    *for* i *in* range(len(numbers)):        *if* numbers\[i\] \== target:            *return* i    *return* \-1   | def binary\_search(numbers, target):    low \= 0    high \= len(numbers) \- 1     *while* low \<= high:        middle \= (low \+ high) // 2         *if* numbers\[middle\] \== target:            *return* middle        *elif* numbers\[middle\] \< target:            low \= middle \+ 1        *else*:            high \= middle \- 1     *return* \-1   |

## **Questions with Checklists**

### **1\. Efficiency**

Which algorithm is faster when the list of numbers is very large? Why?

Implementation 2 (Binary) because it splits the list in half repeatedly and checking rather than linear which checks each item one by one 

**Checklist to guide your answer:**

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| ~~How many elements might the algorithm need to check? Does the algorithm reduce the search area as it runs? Does the algorithm still work efficiently with a very large list?~~ | How many elements might the algorithm need to check? Does the algorithm reduce the search area as it runs? Does the algorithm still work efficiently with a very large list? |

**2\. Readability**

Which algorithm is easier to understand at first glance? What makes it clearer?

Implementation 1 (Linear) Because it uses one basic loop compared to Implementation 2 which uses multiple IF statements compared to the only one of Linear

**Checklist to guide your answer:**

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| How meaningful are the variable names? How simple is the logic? How concise is the code? How easy is it to follow the search process? | ~~How meaningful are the variable names? How simple is the logic? How concise is the code? How easy is it to follow the search process?~~ |

### **3\. Maintainability**

If you had to modify the program, such as changing what happens when the target is found, which algorithm would be easier to update? Why?

Implementation 1 (Linear) because the code there is simpler therefor has less room for error whilst Implementation 2 is longer and one wrong line in the if statements might break the code

**Checklist to guide your answer:**

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| ~~Is the structure straightforward? Would adding new steps break the code easily? Is there less chance of errors when updating?~~ | Is the structure straightforward? Would adding new steps break the code easily? Is there less chance of errors when updating? |

### 

### **4\. Testability**

Which algorithm is easier to test with different inputs? Why?

Implementation 1 (Linear) Linear search asks a simpler question and only one question rather than Implementation 2 asks multiple questions

**Checklist to guide your answer:**

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| ~~Can you test with small lists easily? Does the algorithm have fewer conditions to check? Is the output predictable and clear?~~ | Can you test with small lists easily? Does the algorithm have fewer conditions to check? Is the output predictable and clear? |

### **5\. Reliability and Input Validation**

What should the algorithm check to avoid errors when receiving input from a user?

Checks needed, if the list is empty, if the list contains wrong data,if the list is sorted because binary completely fails on unsorted list 

**Checklist to guide your answer:**

| Implementation 1 | Implementation 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| Does the algorithm check if the list is empty? Does it handle invalid inputs (like letters instead of numbers)? Does it avoid crashing when inputs are unusual? Does it check that the list is sorted before using Linear Search? | ~~Does the algorithm check if the list is empty? Does it handle invalid inputs (like letters instead of numbers)? Does it avoid crashing when inputs are unusual? Does it check that the list is sorted before using Binary Search?~~ |

### 

### **6\. Final Answer**

Based on your answers from 1 to 5, Which algorithm would you choose for this problem, and under what conditions would the other algorithm be more suitable? Summarize your answer.

The problem clearly states the list is already sorted, Binary Search saves a lot of time on large lists. Use Linear Search if the list is unsorted or if the list is very small.
